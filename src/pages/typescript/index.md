## Why do we want to use Typescript?

TypeScript is a programming language that is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, meaning that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. TypeScript adds several features to JavaScript that make it easier to write and maintain large scale applications, including:

1. Type annotations: TypeScript allows you to add type annotations to variables, functions, and object properties to specify the type of value they are expected to hold. This can help catch errors at compile-time, rather than runtime, and can also provide better documentation for your code.
2. Classes and interfaces: TypeScript supports object-oriented programming concepts such as classes and interfaces, which can help you write more organized and reusable code.
3. Modules: TypeScript supports the use of modules, which can help you organize your code into smaller, more manageable pieces.
4. Static typing: TypeScript's static typing can help catch errors and provide better code completion and IntelliSense in your editor or IDE.

Overall, TypeScript can help you write more reliable and scalable code, and is particularly well-suited for large-scale applications that require a lot of code organization and maintenance.
